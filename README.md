Generate a yWriter project from an Aeon Timeline 3 project file.

For more information, see the [project homepage](https://peter88213.github.io/aeon3yw) with description and download instructions.

## Development

*aeon3yw* is organized as an Eclipse PyDev project. The official release branch on GitHub is *main*.

## Important

Please note that the program has not yet been extensively tested. To me, it's actually just a proof of concept. I probably won't develop the program further. Feel free to copy the project and modify it to your own liking.

### Conventions

- Minimum Python version is 3.6. 
- The Python **source code formatting** follows widely the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide, except the maximum line length, which is 120 characters here.

### Development tools

- [Python](https://python.org) version 3.9
- [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org) with [PyDev](https://pydev.org) and [EGit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) for building the application script

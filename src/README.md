# Please note:

Location of the  **paeon**  library: https://github.com/peter88213/paeon
Location of the  **PyWriter**  library: https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter

It is advised to clone these projects at the same directory level as the  *yw-cnv*  project and set a project reference to it. So the build scripts can generate the  *aeon3yw*  script.

The *cnvaeon* macro only works in the LibreOffice Python context. In order to execute tests in the development environment, there is the *cnvaeon_stub_* script that has to be kept up date with the *cnvaeon_* script.
